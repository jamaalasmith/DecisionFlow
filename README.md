# 🛰️ DecisionFlow

**Modular AI Decision Support System**  
_Designed for mission-critical environments where human judgment meets machine intelligence._

---

## 🧭 Vision

DecisionFlow is a Python-powered, modular AI assistant built to support high-stakes human decision-making — whether in a cockpit, command center, remote field, or eventual space mission.

This project models human-AI co-reasoning: the ability for software to **suggest**, **justify**, and **defer** to human judgment. It emphasizes clarity, adaptability, and ethical decision paths.

Think flipping analysis, medical triage, EVA planning, or spacecraft anomaly handling — all powered by pluggable logic and explainable AI.

## 🚀 Key Features

- 🧠 **Modular ML engine** – Swap in/out scikit-learn or custom models
- 🗺️ **Decision traceability** – Logs reasoning steps + confidence levels
- ⚙️ **Custom rules engine** – Add your own domain logic or conditions
- 📦 **FastAPI + React UI (optional)** – Expand to full-stack when ready
- ☁️ **Cloud or local ready** – Deploy in offline or mission-safe environments

## 🌌 Why This Project Exists

By 2030, astronauts, scientists, and field operators will increasingly rely on AI not to replace them — but to **think alongside them**. DecisionFlow is a training ground for that reality.

It reflects the belief that intelligent systems should:
- Augment, not override  
- Explain, not obscure  
- Fail gracefully, not dangerously
